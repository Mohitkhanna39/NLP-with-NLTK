# NLP-with-NLTK
NLTK explaination with code in Python

Here, I will talk about natural language processing (NLP) using Python. This NLP tutorial will use the Python NLTK library. NLTK is a popular Python library which is used for NLP.

So what is NLP? And what are the benefits of learning NLP?

Put simply, natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that are able to understand human languages.

We are talking here about practical examples of natural language processing (NLP) like speech recognition, speech translation, understanding complete sentences, understanding synonyms of matching words, and writing complete grammatically correct sentences and paragraphs.

NLP Implementations
These are some successful implementations of natural language processing (NLP):

* Search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. Google's search engine understands that you are a tech guy, so it shows you results related to that.
* Social website feeds like your Facebook news feed. The news feed algorithm understands your interests using natural language processing and shows you related ads and posts more likely than other posts.
* Speech engines like Apple Siri.
- Spam filters like Google spam filters. It's not just about your usual spam filtering; now, spam filters understand what's inside the email content and see if it's spam or not.

NLP Libraries
There are many open source Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. These are some of them:

Natural language toolkit (NLTK)
Apache OpenNLP
Stanford NLP suite
Gate NLP library
Natural language toolkit (NLTK) is the most popular library for natural language processing (NLP). It was written in Python and has a big community behind it.

NLTK also is very easy to learn, actually, it's the easiest natural language processing (NLP) library that you'll use.
